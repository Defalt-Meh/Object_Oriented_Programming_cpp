The purpose of this Bank Management System program is to simulate basic banking operations 
using object-oriented programming in C++. It manages accounts and transactions, allowing users
to add accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and track transactions.

Key functionalities include:
  -Account Management: Create and remove accounts with initial balances.
  -Transaction Processing: Handle deposits and withdrawals, recording each transaction.
  -Data Display: Show current account details and transaction history.

The program reads data from files to initialize accounts and transactions, making it easy to
test various scenarios and ensure accurate financial operations. This simple yet effective system
demonstrates core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in a practical
application.
