# The Fellowship of the Code: A C++ OOP Adventure

Welcome, brave coder, to the mythical repository of C++ Object-Oriented Programming! I’m an undergrad, questing through the lands of academia, battling the dark forces of compiler errors and the orcs of debugging.

One Repo to Rule Them All

In the land of coursework, in the fires of my dorm room, I forged this repository. It is destined to be your guide through the treacherous paths of C++ OOP. Here, you’ll find:

Classes and Objects: The foundation of our journey, where we craft our heroes and villains.
Inheritance: Passing down the traits of mighty ancestors to their descendants.
Polymorphism: The art of many forms, allowing our objects to wield multiple abilities.
Encapsulation: Guarding our precious data with the strength of Gondor’s walls.
Abstraction: Simplifying the chaos, like Gandalf calming a panicked fellowship.
Join the Quest

Whether you’re a fellow undergrad or a seasoned wizard, this repository is your ally. Together, we shall conquer the challenges of C++ OOP and bring peace to our code.

Remember, young hobbit: not all those who wander are lost. Some are just looking for that elusive semicolon.

May your pointers always point true, and your memory leaks be few!
